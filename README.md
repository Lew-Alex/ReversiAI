# ReversiAI

This project presents a comprehensive implementation of the Reversi game in Python, utilizing the Pygame library for graphical representation. The code establishes the game state, including the board layout and player turns, and implements essential game logic functions such as determining valid moves and flipping opponent discs. Additionally, a draw function is provided to visually render the game board.
