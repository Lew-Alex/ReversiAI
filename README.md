# ReversiAI

This project presents a comprehensive implementation of the Reversi game in Python, utilizing the Pygame library for graphical representation. The code establishes the game state, including the board layout and player turns, and implements essential game logic functions such as determining valid moves and flipping opponent discs. Additionally, a draw function is provided to visually render the game board.

Furthermore, the project explores the development of an AI opponent employing the minimax algorithm. This AI opponent strategically evaluates potential future game states, enabling it to make optimal moves by maximizing its own score while considering the opponent's potential actions. Through meticulous design and execution, this project offers both a fully-functional Reversi game and insights into constructing intelligent AI adversaries for board games.
